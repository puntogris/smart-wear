Swiping down on the weather screen will refresh the data.

### How do i unlock the watermelon?
I give you a hint, click something in the settings screen.

### Is the weather and clothing recommendation 100% accurate?
No, it's design to get a general idea of what to wear. It should work in most of the cases.

I would like to improve on it in the future using AI so we can get a more accurate result.
